# Food Bell Patch Note

The Food Bell Patch Note is a solo project where I analyzed, designed, and developed a patch note system for the fictive website, Food Bell.

This project provided me with the opportunity to enhance my skills in React and learn .Net, as it was my first exposure to the framework.

I took on all aspects of development independently, showcasing my skills and passion for web development. The project reflects my commitment to continuous learning and improvement in the field.

Feel free to explore the features of the Food Bell Patch Note, and reach out if you have any questions or feedback.
